# ML-Coursera
Includes any programs I made while taking the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera

**linear_regression.ipynb:** An implementation of the linear regression algorithm taught in the course. Uses the multivariable Boston housing dataset and attempts to predict house prices.

**logistic_regression.ipynb:** An implementation of the logistic regression algorithm taught in the course along with weight regularization techniques. Uses a custom dataset for easy visualisation.
